{"name":"enterprise-toolkit","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to the enterprise-toolkit for Google Apps Admins.\r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Toolkit is a set of command-line scripts that make use of the Google Apps Admin SDK API: https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/. The scripts are a good way to get introduced and experiment with the API. They allow easy chaining of commands via simple shell scripts or more interesting Python modules.\r\n\r\nSee the README files for more information about the scripts and a link to our support group.  See the INSTALL and HOWTO files for help installing and running the scripts.  ","google":"UA-25706479-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
