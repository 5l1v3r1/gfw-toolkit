This is an example solution demonstrating the user parts of the
Admin SDK API and Google+ Domains API.

The solution includes Python code examples of:
-authenticating using OAuth2
-using Google's discoverable APIs (https://developers.google.com/discovery/)
-parsing results from API calls
-handling errors from API calls
-retrying API calls due to per-second quota responses

The solution is divided between 4 main directories:
-admin_sdk_directory_api: code to wrap admin_sdk api supported.
-cmds: command line wrappers that invoke the api wrappers for easy use/testing.
-plus_domains_api: code to wrap plus_domains api supported.
-utils: helper code that is used commonly used across cmds.

Please follow the instructions in the INSTALL file to get the required setup
steps completed so you can use this toolkit.

Review the HOWTO files for detailed examples of running the cmds and
reviewing their output.
